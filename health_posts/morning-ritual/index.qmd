<p>We all have our own morning routines, whether it's grabbing a cup of coffee and checking our emails, hitting the snooze button and rolling out of bed at the last minute, or diving into a workout before the sun rises. But have you ever stopped to think about how your morning ritual affects the rest of your day? Establishing a healthy morning ritual can have a multitude of benefits, both physically and mentally. Here are just a few of the ways that starting your day off on the right foot can positively impact your life.</p>

 	<li>Boosts Energy and Productivity</li>
</ol>
When you establish a consistent morning ritual that includes exercise, healthy food choices, and a little bit of quiet time, you set yourself up for a day of energy and productivity. Exercise releases endorphins, which can boost your mood and energy levels, while a healthy breakfast can provide the fuel your body needs to power through the day. Taking a few moments to clear your mind and set intentions for the day ahead can also help you stay focused and motivated throughout the day.

<blockquote>Two years ago, my friends and I established a morning routine of rising at 4am for a refreshing run to a nearby forest. After reaching the forest, we would take 10 minutes to meditate and perform a variety of physical exercises such as pull-ups, push-ups, leg stretches, and vocal exercises. Upon returning home, we would take a quick, invigorating cold shower and consume two boiled eggs. To start our day off right, we would spend approximately 30 minutes reading a self-help book while basking in the morning sun. This healthy morning routine had an incredibly positive effect on us. We were motivated throughout the day and felt like we had more time than everyone else. During the six months of our morning runs, we achieved so much that many of us developed a strong proficiency in our respective areas of interest. For example: I myself developed strong proficiency in R programming and reading habits</blockquote>

Starting your day with a healthy morning ritual can also have a significant impact on your mental health. Taking time for yourself in the morning, whether it's through meditation, journaling, or simply enjoying a cup of tea, can help you feel centered and calm. This can reduce feelings of stress and anxiety that may otherwise set the tone for the rest of your day.

<blockquote>A famous neurologist Andrew says " start taking a cold shower in the morning. this reduces your heartbeat for the whole day which means lowered cortisol level. This keeps you focused and motivated. Do it for couple of months and you are ahead by 5 years of yourself</blockquote>

 	3.Improves Sleep

Establishing a healthy morning ritual can also help improve your sleep. Waking up at the same time each day, regardless of whether it's a weekday or weekend, can help regulate your body's internal clock and promote healthy sleep patterns. Additionally, incorporating relaxation techniques into your morning routine can help reduce insomnia and improve the overall quality of your sleep.

Our morning runs also had a remarkable effect on our sleep cycle. Despite being night owls who typically stayed up until midnight, we found ourselves feeling drowsy and ready for bed at 9pm. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what changed, but during our runs, our bodies seemed to naturally regulate our sleep hormones. Our melatonin levels were so high that we could fall asleep with ease, allowing us to wake up well-rested and energized for the next day's activities.

A healthy morning ritual can also boost your mental clarity and creativity. When you take time to quiet your mind and focus on the present moment, you may find that your thoughts become clearer and more organized. This can help you approach your work and personal life with a greater sense of creativity and innovation.

<blockquote>Finally, establishing a healthy morning ritual can help promote self-care. By taking time for yourself each morning, you show yourself that you are a priority. This can boost self-esteem and overall well-being, as well as help you set healthy boundaries and prioritize self-care throughout the day.
