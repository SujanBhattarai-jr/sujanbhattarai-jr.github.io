<p>It should not be surprising that there exists a suicide forest in Japan named Aokigahara, which reports the highest number of suicidal incidents worldwide. Historically, suicide was considered an act of courage by Samurai, trained warriors. However, the present scenario has changed, and many suicidal incidents now stem from stress, financial burden, betrayal in love, arguments, and other factors. A psychologist researching the Aokigahara forest identified that many suicidal incidents were primarily due to mental causes, particularly work stress. Japan and Korea report the highest number of work hours per day, which correlates with the high rate of suicides from such stress.</p>

# Hiking in the Mountains: Everyone Should Try It

<blockquote>
In our modernizing world, it is essential to take breaks from daily office schedules and stabilize mental health using natural methods. One highly effective method is hiking. Hiking offers several psychological and physical benefits, including boosting immunity, reducing mental anxiety, increasing stamina, and lowering hypertension and blood pressure. Considering these benefits, a specific form of hiking called <em>Shinrin-yoku</em>, or forest bathing, was introduced in Japan in the 1980s. Participants spend a week in a forest, detached from electronic devices and the internet. This practice has shown significant improvements in depression.

<p>Since Covid-19, hiking has gained popularity in urban areas. Many people have adopted hiking as a regular hobby. But why should you partake in hiking, and what natural healing benefits can you achieve from it?</p>

<blockquote>
Ayurveda, the oldest form of medicine in Hindu culture, describes the balance of five earth elements (fire, water, sky, earth, air) in our body that defines our health. If all these five elements can be activated in the body, both body and mind can heal themselves. The psychosomatic theory also supports this, explaining that the mind can create illness in the body. Hiking in natural areas activates all these five elements, restoring your body and mind.
</blockquote>

<p>Scientifically, this can be explained in simpler terms. "All forms of living species on Earth share some prey-predator relationships, including plants and insects. To protect themselves from insects, trees release chemicals called phytoncides. These chemicals have antifungal and antibacterial properties, helping plants fight diseases. When we breathe in these chemicals, our bodies respond by increasing white blood cells, activating our natural killer cells. These killer cells protect us from diseases and boost our immunity."</p>

<p><strong>2. Lower blood pressure and hypertension:</strong></p>

<p>The benefits of hiking in reducing blood pressure and hypertension have been reported globally. Several studies have validated that walking in green areas significantly reduces blood pressure. The most recent finding involved 20 clinical trials with over 732 participants. Those who regularly walked in green spaces or spent some time in green areas weekly significantly reduced their blood pressure.</p>

<blockquote>
In an experiment where participants were advised to walk in green and non-green areas, green areas showed a massive drop in blood pressure compared to non-green spaces. These findings may relate to the human evolutionary lifecycle, as humans evolved in forests and green spaces. It makes sense that we naturally prefer green areas that release happy hormones, stabilizing the brain.

<p><strong>3. Reduces anxiety and panic attacks</strong></p>

<p>The adrenaline rush produced in the human body accumulates if not released. Over time, this accumulated adrenaline causes muscle tension and depression. Walking and hiking help release this excess energy, improving mood and freshness. A study on forest bathing participants measured their mental health and anxiety levels during the forest bathing period. The study showed a significant decline in anxiety levels, depression symptoms, and stress.</p>

<p><strong>4. Improves physical health</strong></p>

<p>Improvement of physical health is the most immediate benefit of hiking. On average, 100 calories are burned for every mile walked at a rate of 2.5 miles per hour. If the walking speed increases, the calorie burn can reach 500 per hour. These calorie-burning activities and walking increase bone density and reduce bone wear. The same process also helps reduce arthritis and osteoporosis. Other health benefits include increased insulin resistance and prevention of diabetes, which develop from increased physical activities like walking in the forest.</p>
