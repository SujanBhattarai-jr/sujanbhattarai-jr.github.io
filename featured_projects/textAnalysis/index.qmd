In today's era of burgeoning information, understanding the predominant
themes and trends in vast volumes of text data is crucial for extracting
meaningful insights. This project focuses on leveraging Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze a collection of articles centered
on climate science. By employing advanced computational methods, I aim
to uncover the most prevalent topics discussed across these articles,
shedding light on key issues and their interconnectedness within the
domain of climate science.

## Objectives

1.  **Data Collection and Preparation**
    -   **Data Retrieval:** Obtain a comprehensive dataset comprising
        articles related to climate science, sourced from diverse
        publications.
    -   **Data Cleaning:** Standardize and preprocess the text data to
        remove noise, such as URLs, dates, and duplicates, ensuring a
        clean corpus for analysis.
2.  **Topic Modeling and Optimization**
    -   **Topic Extraction:** Apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to
        identify latent topics within the article corpus.
    -   **Optimization:** Determine the optimal number of topics using
        quantitative metrics such as CaoJuan2009 and Deveaud2014,
        ensuring robust and interpretable results.
3.  **Insights Generation**
    -   **Topic Interpretation:** Analyze and interpret the extracted
        topics to discern prevalent themes and their implications in
        climate science research.
    -   **Visualization:** Visualize topic distributions and top terms
        to facilitate intuitive understanding and exploration of
        thematic clusters.

```

or my sets of articles, the optimization metrics continuously resulted
in Null, showing that the model is not able to find the best value of k.
However, the optimization metrics for the model with k = 2 is the
lowest, suggesting that the model with k = 2 is the best model for my
data set. The plots show a similar result, as there is no stabilization
of trend for different values of optimization metrics. So, for the
dataset, I will go with the model with k = 2.

```{r}
# Plot the top terms in each topic
terms(topicModel_k2, 10) # Most probable words in each topic

tmResult <- posterior(topicModel_k2)
terms(topicModel_k2)

theta <- tmResult$topics
beta <- tmResult$terms
vocab <- colnames(beta)

# Plot the distribution of topics across a sample of the documents from beta
topics <- tidy(topicModel_k2, matrix = "beta")

top_terms <- topics |> 
  group_by(topic) |> 
  top_n(10, beta) |> 
  ungroup() |> 
  arrange(topic, -beta)

kableExtra::kable(top_terms)

# Plot the distribution of topics across a sample of the documents from theta

top_terms |> 
  mutate(term = reorder_within(term, beta, topic, sep = "")) |> 
  ggplot(aes(term, beta, fill = factor(topic))) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~topic, scales = "free_y") +

Upon analyzing the topics extracted from the articles using a two-topic
classification model, it becomes evident that the primary focus of the
articles revolves around polar bears, as indicated by the presence of
the search item 'polar bear' across all topics. The specificity of the
search item directly influences the thematic coherence of the topics.

In the first topic, discussions predominantly centers around polar bear
hunting and climate change research. This topic also touches on sea ice
and the Arctic, possibly suggesting a thematic exploration of the
ecological and environmental challenges faced by polar bears in the
context of climate change.

Lastly, the second topic likely appears to explore the intricate
relationship between polar bears and the importance of World Ice Day. It
highlights the interconnectedness of these elements within the Arctic
ecosystem, emphasizing the ecological implications of environmental
shifts on polar bear populations and the emotion of the global
community.

Overall, the topics extracted from the articles provide valuable
insights that polar bears are not talked about in any other topics,
other than explicitly discussing polar bears. Exploring more articles
and topics could provide more insights on the themes discussed in the
articles, but for my subset of articles, polar bears are not discussed
in any other context other than research and when discussing
international ice days.
