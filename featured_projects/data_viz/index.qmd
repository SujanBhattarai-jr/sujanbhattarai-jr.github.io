#### Introduction about the project

This project aims to create infographics comparing attributes of soccer
players, sourced from a European soccer database available on Kaggle.
The database contains data on over 10,000 players. Using R exclusively,
the visualization focuses on attributes such as shooting, finishing,
strength, age, etc. All tasks, from fetching the data to adding text and
aligning elements, are performed using R packages. Special credit is
given to the UFO alien template, accessible at [UFO
link](https://github.com/doehm/tidytues/blob/main/scripts/2023/week-25-ufo/ufo.png)

Important Note: The ggplot package version used in this project is
3.4.4, and ggtern version 3.0.0 is utilized. It's crucial to consider
that modern versions of ggplot might conflict when used in combination
with other packages employed here.

```

#### Data Wrangling

The datasets available on Kaggle are stored in SQLite and require joins
to build a complete dataset. However, for this project, data from a
single table is sufficient. Nevertheless, for future use, datasets will
be combined if necessary.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#read the csv file
player_attr <- read_csv(here("featured_projects/data_viz/player_attr.csv"))

```

The dataset includes a column named "overall ratings," representing the
FIFA average rating from 2008 to 2016. This column will be utilized to
categorize players into Advanced, Intermediate, and Novice. It's
important to note that the term "Novice" is used for classification
purposes and does not undermine any players; it's simply a
classification based on personal preference.

```{r}
#---classify the players based on their overall rating
player_attr <- player_attr %>% 
  mutate(player_class = ifelse(overall_rating >= 85, "Advanced", 
                                 ifelse(overall_rating >= 70 & overall_rating < 85, "Intermediate", "Novice")))

```

The project will compare the following attributes of players. The
hypothesis is whether there exists a difference in attributes between
the world's renowned top performers and players who do not enjoy the
same level of popularity.

```{r}
# filter required columns from the dataset
player_data <- player_attr %>% 
        select(player_name, player_class, crossing, agility, 
               dribbling, finishing, aggression, balance, strength, stamina)

```

From the database containing over 10,000 players, only a subset is
required. A random sample of 1000 players will be drawn from the
intermediate and novice categories, while all players from the advanced
category will be included, given that there are already fewer than 1000
advanced category players.

```{r}
#---filter only good players from the player_data datase
good_players <- player_data %>% filter(player_class == "Advanced")

#---filter average and bad players from the player_data dataset
set.seed(123)
average_bad_players <- player_data %>% filter(player_class != "Advanced") %>% 
  #sample only 1000 from average and bad players
  group_by(player_class) %>% 
  #randomly select 1000 players from each class and always include the player Van dijk in the sample
  sample_n(1000)

#good defender van dijk
van_dijk <- player_data %>% filter(player_name == "Virgil van Dijk")

#---combine the good_players and average_bad_players datasets
clean_player_data <- bind_rows(good_players, average_bad_players, van_dijk)

```

#### PLot1: Radar plot for common attributes comparison

```{r,  fig.width= 0.5, fig.height=0.5}
#summarize the data and plot the summary output with radar chart
radar_data <- clean_player_data %>% 
  group_by(player_class) %>% 
  select(-player_name,  player_class) %>%
  summarise_all(mean, na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  arrange(ifelse(player_class == "Advanced", 1, ifelse(player_class == "Intermediate", 2, 3))) %>% 
  #arrange so that corssing, finishing, driblling and agility are away from each other
  rename("finish"= "finishing") %>% 
  select(player_class, crossing, aggression, agility, balance, dribbling, stamina, finish, strength)

#create custom color paletteA
colors <- c("#7f58AF", "#64C5EB", "#E84D8A", "#FEB326", "lightblue")

radar_plot <- ggradar::ggradar(radar_data,
        grid.min = 0,
        grid.max =  100,
        grid.mid = 50,

        gridline.mid.colour = "#27593d",
        group.point.size  = 2,
        grid.label.size = 20,
        group.colours = c("#7f58AF", "#64C5EB", "#E84D8A"),
        background.circle.colour = "white",
        legend.title  = "Players proficiency",

#### Plot2: Stat-halfeye plot for age distribution

```{r}
library(ggdist)

#### Plot3: Ternary plot for 3 major attributes comparison

```{r out.height= "100%", out.width="100%"}
#standarize the clean_player_data for all numeric columns based on min and max value

#### Infographics:aesthetics buildup

This segment and beyond involves, creating text, plots, base plots, etc
aesthetics for the final infographics. Most of these are derived from
UFO plot, as mentioned in the introduction of this document.

Images cannot be loaded into ggplot object directly. it should be
convereted to raster object and then it can be overlaid over other
ggplot object. The following codes achieves the same thing for different
images that are used in the final infographics.

```{r}

#load the tern image
image <- readPNG("image/tern_plot.png")
tern_image <- as.raster(image)

#radar plot
radar <- readPNG("image/radar_plot.png")
radar_image <- as.raster(radar)

#tern plot image
image <- readPNG("image/tern_plot.png")
image <- as.raster(image)

#lionel messi image
messi <- readJPEG("data/images/messi.jpg")
messi <- as.raster(messi)

#fifa logo image
fifa <- readPNG("data/images/FIFA.png")
fifa <- as.raster(fifa)

#goalpost as image
soccer_field <- readJPEG("data/images/soccer-field.jpg")
soccer_field <- as.raster(soccer_field)

```

The final graph is produced from the following line. This chunk adds all
previously made plots and inset them into appropriate locations, based
on preference. This process takes really long time, as finding the exact
location from just point values is significantly tedious task. I would
suggest using any other graphical interface software to add the quotes
and paragraphs, which takes way less time.

```{r}
# Combine the plots into a single infographic
g_final <- g_base +
  inset_element(fifa, left = 0.9, right = 1.08, top = 0.25, bottom = -0.2)+
  inset_element(eye_plot, left = -0.12, right = 0.57, top = 1, bottom = 0.66) +
  #insert radar plot
  inset_element(tern_image, left = -0.10, right = 0.80, top = 0.5, bottom = -.1) +
  inset_element(messi, left = -0.08, right = 0.15, top = 0.50, bottom = 0.15) +
  inset_element(radar_plot, left = 0.4, right = 1.1, top = 0.81, bottom = 0.31) +
  #insert quote 1

  #insert quote 4

#### For further information and the Initial motivation behind project, please follow:

In all sports domain, some players always stands out in popularity. For
example, Lebron James in Basketball, Khabib Nurmagomedov in UFC, Serena
Williams in Tennis, and Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in Soccer.
But why do some players always stand out ? Does it relates to their
ability to perform better than other players ? This is the central
question of this project, which will explore how attributes between
advanced and novice category differs.

The project utilizes the soccer dataset from European soccer database,
which has data about more than 10000 players and currently open source
at Kaggle website. The dataset contains all information about every
games played, home goals wins for teams, aways goals wins or losses,
individual players attributes like shooting, strength, skill, balance,
kicking, crossing, volleying and all other attributes that are described
in soccer playing. This project only utilizes the player attributes data
and not the team data, and explores the players attributes. The players
will first be categorized into advanced, intermediate, and novice based
on fifa ranking. Fifa ranking is available for each of those players,
which is a average ratings of the overall performance of the player
since 2008 season to 2016. All players with average ratings higher than
85 are classified as advanced player, 70-85 as intermediate, and \<70 as
novice players.

For the infographics design, all information and codes help is archived
from UFO infographics template. All designed are done only inside R and
no other graphical editing softwares will be used. Three of the
graphics: eyeplot, radar plot, and tern plot is used for attributes
comparison. The base template will be created with ggplot which will
have all other plots overlaid over it. The title and subtitle will be
highlighted at the top. The subtitle will explains players and their
category. For example: all advanced players in the infographics is
represented as purple color, and that thing is shown from how subtitle
is highlighted. The colors are chosen neutral in appearance with
excellent contrast for quick differentiation. These colors are supposed
to be colorblind friendly. The text sizes, themes, background, and
spacing are all first defined based on the base template of the
infographics. To avoid information overloading, none of the legend and
axis are kept, since quick explanation at the paragraph should be
sufficient. Some top performers like Lionel messi, Cristiano Ronaldo,
and Virgil van Djik, who are some of the most popular players, are
highlighted and annotated to contextualize the data. This should help
where the worlds famous players stand. All my plots also centers the
message about attributes comparison among different category soccer
players. For example, the ternary plot will have the circled grouped
data based on 95% confidence interval for all categories. This should
help where categories overlap. This approach was able to show the high
overlapped categories.

<p>The DEI approach is not satisfied for this plot, because in order to
understand what player attributes are, an audience should be knowledged
about the soccer games. So, this infographics is designed only for
soccer fans, and none else. This data-viz project concludes that the
difference between advanced and novice category is subtle.</p>
