This outcome aligns with expectations, as air quality is directly impacted by the smoke and dust emitted from burning crop residues.

Instead of utilizing a rolling mean, I opted to normalize the data by the total cultivable area. To elaborate, the graph presented illustrates emissions categorized by country. However, this representation is biased due to the fact that India, with its larger area and population, naturally yields a higher total emission. To address this bias, the emission values were divided by the total cultivable area within each country, resulting in emissions per unit of cultivable area. This approach is more precise and provides a more accurate assessment.\n\n#further data exploration\nggplot(south_asian_data, aes(year, crop_residues, color = area)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_grid(cols = vars(area)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year 1990-2020\",\n    y = \"Emission from Crop Burning(kilotonnes)\") +\n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"Country\") +\n  theme_bw()+\n  theme(\n      # Remove x-axis title\n    axis.text.x = element_blank()    # Remove x-axis labels\n  )+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(south_asian_data$year), max(south_asian_data$year), by = 30))  # Adjust the breaks as needed\n\n\n\n\nTotal crop burning emission in Each south Asian Nations since 1990\n\n\n\n# Save the plot\nggsave(\"explore.png\", width = 10, height = 5)\n\nUpon normalizing the emissions, the resulting graph reveals a notable shift in findings.

In this context, I applied a linear regression model to assess the strength of the relationship between crop residues and air quality. Bangladesh stands out as having the highest emissions from crop residues in the South Asian region. The objective is to quantify the robustness of the correlation between crop residues and air quality in this particular context.\n\n#  work for bangladesh\ndata &lt;- c(52.90993831, 51.64362616,\n53.74695817, 55.06194439, 56.41649854, 60.5358739, 68.94271136, 66.42738113, 73.27082296, 68.97033719, 67.7673598, 62.75318316, 63.27546257)\n\n# Duplicate the first two values four times each\ndata &lt;- c(rep(data[1:5], each = 4), data[3:length(data)])\n\n# Create a data frame with a single column\nBangladesh &lt;- data.frame(aqi_value = data)\n\n\n#combine this with SA Data for Bangladesh only\nbangladesh_filtered &lt;- normalized_area  %&gt;%\n                       filter(area ==  \"Bangladesh\") %&gt;% \n                       cbind(Bangladesh)\n\n\n##test the model here\n#| code-fold: false\nmodel_bangladesh &lt;- lm(data = bangladesh_filtered, aqi_value ~ crop_residues)\nsummary(model_bangladesh)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = aqi_value ~ crop_residues, data = bangladesh_filtered)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-7.502 -1.442 -0.367  1.563 11.405 \n\nCoefficients:\n               Estimate Std.

The next step involves a shift to a more detailed exploration using monthly time series to uncover the nuanced trends in air quality in Bangladesh.

For instance, villagers might engage in burning crop residues on days with less wind, and with numerous villagers participating, these activities may take place on different days. Unfortunately, the unavailability of online sources providing monthly data on crop emissions has led us to focus on plotting a time series for monthly air quality. This approach aims to capture the broader trends associated with air quality fluctuations in the absence of specific monthly data on crop emissions.\n\n##load feasts package, these contains mostly time series functions \nlibrary(feasts)\nlibrary(tsibble)\nlibrary(forecast)\n\n##change date format\ndaily_aqi_filtered &lt;- daily_aqi_filtered %&gt;%\n                      mutate(date_column = as.Date(daily_aqi_filtered$`Date (LT)`, \n                            format = \"%m/%d/%Y %H:%M\")) %&gt;% \n                      na.omit()\n\n\nplot(daily_aqi_filtered$AQI,  xlab = \"Year 2016 - 2022\", ylab = \"AQI value\", main = NA)\n\n\n\n\nHourly time-series data for AQI value in Bangladesh between 2016(inclusive) and 2022(inclusive)\n\n\n\n\n\n# Aggregate by month\nmonthly_aggregated &lt;- daily_aqi_filtered %&gt;%\n                      mutate(month = month(date_column),\n                             year = year(date_column)) %&gt;% \n                      group_by(year, month) %&gt;% \n                      summarize(aqi_sum = mean(AQI)) %&gt;% \n                      mutate(date_column = make_date(year, month))\n\n##convert this to tsibble\ndf &lt;- monthly_aggregated %&gt;%\n      mutate(date = yearmonth(date_column))\ndf &lt;- as_tsibble(df, index = date)\ndf &lt;- df[c('date', 'aqi_sum')]\n\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  stl(t.window = 13, s.window = \"periodic\", robust = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  autoplot() +\n  ggtitle(\"\") +\n  labs(x = \"Time\", y = \"Value\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n        legend.title = element_blank(),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 12))\n\n\n\n\nSeasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess(STL)\n\n\n\n\nContrary to my initial expectations, the time series analysis revealed the presence of seasonality, a factor I had not anticipated based on my prior knowledge.

The data for training goes up to the year 2010, and forecasts are made for 20 time points (5 years). The individual predictions from each model are combined by averaging them, creating a combined forecast. This combined forecast, along with the original data and predictions from each individual model, is then presented graphically using the autoplot function.

Its extensive time series data provides invaluable insights into the long-term impacts of environmental changes on marine ecosystems and the communities reliant on them, not only within the California Current System but also extending to the North Pacific and beyond on an international scale.\nAs a part of this project, I am supporting the XYZ in predicting the ocean carbon values, which is a crucial part of the marine ecosystem. The dataset contains 12 columns, with 1 response variable and 11 predictors. The response variable is the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration in the ocean, which is a key component of the marine carbon cycle. The predictors include various physical and chemical properties of the ocean, such as temperature, salinity, and oxygen concentration.\nThe goal of this project is to develop two machine learning models that can accurately predict the DIC concentration in the ocean based on the given predictors. This model will help better understand the factors influencing ocean carbon levels and make data-driven decisions to protect marine ecosystems.\n\nStepwise Flow of the Project\n\nLinear Regression Model\nFine Tuned XGBoost Model\n\n\n#hide all warnings\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\n#### Import all necessary libraries\n# import all required libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport xgboost as xgb\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, KFold\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Ridge\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\n\nRead the data and store ID:required during submission for validity check\n\n#-----read train and test set\ntrain_calcofi = pd.read_csv(\"data/train.csv\")\ntest_calcofi  = pd.read_csv(\"data/test.csv\")  \n\n#collect the test ids for testcalcofi, required for submission dataset\ntest_ids = test_calcofi.id\ntest_calcofi = test_calcofi.drop(columns=['id'])\n\n\nData cleaning\nA model is only as good as the data.This step ensures that columns names are standarized, and the columns with inappropriate values are removed.
