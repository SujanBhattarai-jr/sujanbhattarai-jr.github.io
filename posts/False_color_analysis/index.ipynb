        "\n",
        "A false color image involves assigning colors to represent features not easily visible in the natural spectrum. In environmental studies, false color imagery plays a crucial role in highlighting and distinguishing various environmental elements, such as the health of vegetation, changes in land cover, and levels of pollution. By associating different attributes with distinct colors, false color images offer valuable information for assessing and monitoring environmental conditions. They aid in the analysis of ecosystems, climate patterns, and overall environmental health. The provided image belwo illustrates how false color can be applied to enhance the detection of changes. The image in the right is false color that highlights spherules in rocks in Mars. [further information about the image](https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/5838/stone-mountain/)\n",

The false color image provided a visual representation of the fire event, while the examination of air quality data from 2017 and 2018 allowed us to discern notable changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Upon downloading and cleaning the air quality data, aligning coordinate reference systems, and converting netCDF grid cells into a structured array, a comprehensive dataset emerged. The subsequent plotting of air quality changes over the two-year period, along with a discernible spike corresponding to the Thomas fire, painted a compelling narrative of the environmental impact.\n",
        "\n",
        "The utilization of line graphs, coupled with a 20-day rolling average, served as effective tools to illustrate the temporal fluctuations in air quality. The identified spike at the time of the Thomas fire provides clear evidence of the event's influence on the region's air quality. This integrated approach, combining imagery, data analysis, and visualization, enhances our understanding of the broader environmental implications of such natural disasters and underscores the importance of comprehensive monitoring and analysis in safeguarding environmental well-being.\n",
